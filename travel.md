# Travel Information

Kobe [https://www.feel-kobe.jp/en/](https://www.feel-kobe.jp/en/) <br/>
is a beautiful port city with population of 1.5 million in the Kansai Region of Japan. It was a capital of Japan for a very short period (around 1,180 AD), and so you can enjoy both old and modern parts of Kobe. It is famous for Kobe beef and Sake (of Nada Area). 

## Transportation

Although Kobe has a small airport (Kobe Airport - offering flights from 10 cities in Japan), it is more convenient to use the Kansai International Airport, the nearest major international airport from Kobe. If you ride a high-speed ferry, you can reach Kobe in 30 minutes from the Kansai International Airport. Tokyo is about one-hour away by plane, and it takes Shinkansen, or bullet train, about 2 hours and 45 minutes to go from Tokyo Station to Shin-Kobe Station.

## Climate

The summer in Kobe is very hot and humid. But staying in the buildings with air conditioning is comfortable. You could enjoy visiting the Rokko Mountain Range or Suma Beach nearby to cool off.
