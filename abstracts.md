The CCP2023 Organizing Committee cordially invites you to submit abstracts for oral and poster presentations. Abstracts should be prepared in PDF format generated from the template (LaTeX and Microsoft Word) and submitted [online](https://ccp.confit.atlas.jp/). We will accept only one abstract per each presenting author. All abstracts will be reviewed by the CCP2023 Program Committee and assigned to an appropriate session as either an oral or poster presentation.

### Abstract Preparation Guidelines

* Abstracts should be prepared in PDF format generated from the template:

  * LaTeX template: [[tar.gz]](assets/files/template-latex.tar.gz) [[zip]](assets/files/template-latex.zip)
  * Microsoft Word template: [[docx]](assets/files/template-word.docx)

* Abstracts should be prepared in English.
* The length should be one page at maximum.
* The font size of the main text should be 11pt or larger.
* Authors may further edit and modify submitted abstracts until the submission deadline. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their text does not contain typos or grammatical errors.
* No proofreading will be carried out, and no corrections will be possible after the submission deadline.
