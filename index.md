### CCP2023

* Date: August 4 (Fri) - 8 (Tue), 2023
* Venue: [Kobe International Conference Center](https://kobe-cc.jp/en/visitors/), Kobe Port Island, Kobe, Japan

CCP2023 is the 34th in a series of meetings of scientists working in the domain of Computational Physics. The Conference on Computational Physics (CCP) is held every year under the auspices of the [C20 Commission for Computational Physics](https://iupap.org/who-we-are/internal-organization/commissions/c20-computational-physics/) of the [International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP)](assets/images/iupap100.pdf). The conference includes a broad range of computational scientists with common interests in communicating and engaging with their computation-oriented colleagues to exchange information and develop future collaborations. We plan to hold CCP2023 in a hybrid way, namely, on-site and on-line (using an Internet conference system).

### [IUPAP Conference Policies](https://iupap.org/conferences/conference-policies/)

CCP2023 will be conducted in accordance with principles of
the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP)
as stated in the IUPAP resolution passed by the General Assembly in 2008 and 2011. In particular, no bona fide scientist will be excluded from participation on the grounds of national origin, nationality, or political considerations unrelated to science. It is the policy of IUPAP that all participants in Union activities will enjoy an environment which encourages the free expression and exchange of scientific ideas, and is free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.
