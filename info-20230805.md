# Information for on-site oral presentation (2023-08-05)

This is the information for the participants who are going to give on-site oral presentations in parallel sessions (Invited and contributed talks).

When you give your talk, please connect to Zoom and share your slide. The links to Zoom can be obtained from the [program site](https://confit.atlas.jp/guide/event/ccp2023/top?lo=fin&eventCode=ccp2023).

To avoid an unstable internet connection, we prepared Wi-Fi for presenters: 

* SSID: Galaxy ..... - Room2

   (The last number indicates the room number)

* Password: IUPAPccp2023

Please use this Wi-Fi when you use Zoom for your presentation. Note that this Wi-Fi is only for oral presentations. So, please disconnect from the Wi-Fi after your presentation. 

(If you are going to give a Plenary or Keynote talk, please connect your laptop to our device via HDMI.)
